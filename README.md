Agipibi : An Arduino to GPIB Interface
======================================
![](documentation/arduino_and_cable.jpg?raw=true)

DISCLAIMER
----------

This project was never completed due to the loss of access to native GPIB
equipments. As a result a number of planned functionnalities are not implement.
The initial code for SRQ support on Arduino side is known to be buggy and could
lead to a locked state. I would recommend to first inspect - or remove - these
functions in case of trouble with an unresponsive board.

Contributions are still accepted in the form of pull requests to be reviewed.

Description
-----------

Agipibi is a cheap GPIB interface based on the Arduino Mega board or higher
models. It connects scientific instruments using IEEE 488 buses to a computer,
or the micro-controller itself if you integrate it in your own code.
This project goal is to provide the best open source implementation of a GPIB
controller on prototyping platforms. 

Features
--------

  - system controller role
  - act as talker or listener in full address space
  - multiple concurrent listeners
  - switch instruments to remote mode
  - (un)lock front panels
  - fast reading (Arduino is buffering chunks of data)
  - group trigger
  - timeout handling when reading bus

Work-in-progress:

  - SRQ request interruption and serial polling
  - more examples for Tektronix scopes
  - bridge to LabVIEW with a Python script (TCP server)

Usage
-----

This interface was designed for Arduino Mega 1280, to use other boards you'll
have to edit the pin mapping at the top of arduino_mega.ino sketch. Be careful
about the SRQ line that should have an interrupt capable output.

  1. Connect your GPIB bus/instrument to the board with no additional
     component. You'll find examples in the documentation directory.

  2. Build and upload the 'arduino_mega.ino' sketch in Arduino IDE.

  3. Use the Python module 'agipibi.py' to begin tests. Examples are provided.
     It's best to start in a scenario that doesn't require a controller or
     bi-directional communication. At first I put my scope in Talker mode and
     had it transmit a waveform using menus only. The following code would be
     enough in this case.

```python
from agipibi import Agipibi
dev = Agipibi()
if dev.interface_ping():
    dev.gpib_init(controller=False)
    waveform = dev.gpib_read() # press the 'Transmit' scope button
    print 'Received %d bytes' % len(waveform)
else:
    print 'Arduino is not responding'
```
